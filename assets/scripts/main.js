/* 
  Add relevant functions in this file to do the following:
  
  - Load data from the remote server API
  - Create a new DOM sub-tree of elements to display the data in a table
  - Apply sorting of the data based on the user's selection
  - Apply filtering of the data based on the user's selection
  - Any supporting functions required by the above

  Note: You may want to create a function that allows you to create
  arbitrary HTML subtrees by specifying a top-level tag name and
  any child DOM nodes as arguments, then use that to construct the
  DOM tree for the data table.
